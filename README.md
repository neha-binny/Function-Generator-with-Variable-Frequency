# Function-Generator-with-Variable-Frequency
This project contains the design of a function generator that produces three different waveforms: square wave, triangle wave, and sinusoidal wave. It also varies the frequency in the range of 1000-3200Hz using a potentiometer. The circuit is simulated using LtSpice and the PCB layout is made using Kicad.
